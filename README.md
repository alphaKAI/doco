# doco

## About

Yet another fuzzy text selector.
This software is inspired by [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco).
peco is written in Go, a software like peco written in D haven't existed thus I made.
peco doesn't support regex as a search query but doco supports filtering by regex query!

## Option

* `-h`, `--help`: print help menu.
* `-r`, `--regex`: use regex match instead fuzzy match.

## Note

Current version doesn't support multibyte character.
This problem is caused by `termbox`.
This program depends on `termbox-d` and `termbox-d` depends on `termbox`.
`termbox` doesn't support multibyte character.
I'll fix this problem by implementing original CLI tool kit for D.
